I created a working game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python. I did this as a way to start learning Python.

This was my first attempt at creating a project using Python so it is INCREDIBLY basic. The game uses Tkinter to create the UI. There are currently 2 modes in the game. One where you play locally with someone in the same room, so every time you click a box it will alternate between X and O. There is also an Easy AI option where you play against the computer. This AI is extremely trivial and will basically just randomly pick a box that has not already been picked.

I would like to revisit this project by making the UI look better, and adding more difficulty options with stronger AI. However, I currently have other projects that take priority.
